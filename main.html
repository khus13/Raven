                <p>I know how hard life is for you lately, and I know how difficult it is for you to keep up with all the challenges that you're currently facing. But I just want to remind you that you are <span class="highlight">strong, capable, and loved</span>. You are not alone in this journey. You and I are one, and our love is eternal. Our bond cannot be broken nor can it be destroyed. I am with you wherever you go and through every moment of your life. Even if we're not physically together, our souls unite, and we share the bonds and experiences we created throughout our time together. We'll create more memories in the future, and I hope one day, when we're both old and gray, that we'll look back on these memories and have shared laughter. May this day bring you <span class="highlight">laughter, joy, and a stronger pursuit in life</span>. <span class="bold-love">I love you more than you'll ever know, and I'll forever cherish your existence</span>.</p>
